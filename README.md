# Emacs Config

This is my emacs configuration. It was crafted from 2000 until
now. Once in a while I throw away all my configuration just to start
over.

This version uses literal programming with org-babel.

It is heavely influenced by [Sacha Chua's configuration](http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html)
